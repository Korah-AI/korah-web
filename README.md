# Directions
<h2>Jayden is currently developing the new landing page. I'll be working on the actual web application.</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Go to [Korah Website](https://korah.app)</li>
  <li>Fix all the content on the current HTML file</li>
  <li>Download the iPhone images from the website and implement them into the HTML page. Feel free to use Claude to help with implementing them, 
  but make sure you're creating separate image files for them, and linking them (img src = "image.png")</li>
  <li>Make commits as you work and push to main after you review</li>
  <li>Let me know anything you need me to do.</li>
</ol>

# Goals
