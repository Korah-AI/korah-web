# To-do

* When response is too long it stops outputting for some reason
* Need to implement markdown and latex formatting while streaming.
* Implement better prompt engineering and RAG according to user needs (specific subject, AP class, SAT, academy, etc.)
* Incorporate NoteBookLM features

# UI Deisgn To Do

* Fix the web page "are you sure?" pop up to not be a browser one but instead a web one from korah. Like with chat deletion and other things. (Like cards instead or something)
* Make it so that on "Recent Chats" each chat doesn't get like squashed. (Maybe add more space for recent chats than study items. Or 50/50)
* Fix text box for "prompt for AI"
* Make the 3 bar navigation be responsive to the layout. It like vanished when the layout gets too small. (Maybe make it so that the side bar closes but the navigation box stays so that users can still use it.)
* Change settings icon to be different than the light mode icon
* Make the chat box with korah bigger in all aspects.
* Add a delete box for study tools.
